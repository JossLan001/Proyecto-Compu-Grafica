<td><p><h3> 5G - Advanced is the next evolutionary step of 5G technology.</p> 
<p>This brings a new level of advanced functionality beyond connectivity, enabling a wide range of advanced use cases for industries.
It supports advanced applications with greater mobility and high reliability, as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to improve network performance. 
</p>
<pIn addition, further improvements in spectral efficiency and energy savings are achieved. In this article, we take a look at what the advanced era of 5G will bring, how it will change our lives, and how we will get there.
<p>Combining AI/ML data collection and analysis with the implementation of AI/ML technologies in CORE, RAN, and network management is expected to deliver many benefits, including significant new levels of energy efficiency.
</p>
<p>Through the 3GPP standards body, Nokia is leading the implementation of 5G-Advanced. 
Version 18, the first of the 5G-Advanced era, will be released in 2024.</p></h3>

<td><p><h3>Even in their early stages, 5G networks are rolling out faster than 4G/LTE networks. 
Two years after the first launch of LTE, there were 25 million subscriptions on 60 networks. 
By contrast, two years after 5G first launched, there were 340 million subscriptions across 155 networks. 
GSMA Intelligence forecasts that 5G connectivity will reach 692 million subscribers worldwide by the end of 2022. 
In fact, in some markets such as South Korea and the United States, 5G already covers more than 80% of the population.
Nokia has also played a key role in these developments, providing 5G networks to most of the countries that have launched commercial 5G services.
</p>
<p>Standards body 3GPP has standardized the world's first 5G New Radio (NR) solution for the first time with 'Version 15'. <br>
This introduced a whole new cellular system that allowed developers to implement new features on their networks. <br>
The main improvements brought by this iteration were in three areas: Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), and Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC).
</p></h3></tr>
<tr>

<td><p><h3>Release 15 formed the basis for 5G Non-Standalone (NSA) deployments, however, these still relied on 4G LTE infrastructure for the delivery of end-to-end services. 
Indeed, many operators launched commercial 5G services with enhanced eMBB or Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) technology, which were in essence similar to earlier LTE services. 
However, operators in some more advanced markets, such as South Korea, focused on the development of innovative consumer use cases that utilize 5G's more advanced capabilities such as cloud gaming, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and 4K video, with the intention of encouraging subscribers to adopt 5G plans. 
</h3></p>
<p><h3>Release 15 has also enabled further advancements by leading to 5G Standalone (SA), in which the 5G New Radio system is complemented by Standalone 5G Core with optional cloud-based network functions.
3GPP followed with Releases 16 and 17 which introduced enhancements for Industrial IoT (IIoT) including innovations to support time-sensitive communication (TSC), and the wider expansion of the 5G ecosystem, enhanced MIMO, small data transmission (SDT), User Equipment energy -saving, and many more enhancements.
Other areas include segmentation support, edge computing, and non-terrestrial networks (NTN). For mobile operators, these sectors have provided the opportunity to serve industrial environments such as mining and transportation, and offer enterprise customers the opportunity to digitize their operations and processes. 
</p>
<p>
Industry 4.0 is one of the first sectors that will really benefit from 5G services to improve productivity and manufacturing.
</p>
<p>For example, in certain use cases, 5G will provide high-quality video streaming, live mobile video recording, and streaming of multiple video streams for different use cases, such as advanced video analytics and video surveillance.
</p>
<p>
The arrival of version 18 marks another important advance in 5G technology that will propel the industry into the 5G-Advanced era.

<tr>
<td><p><h3>The 5G network is ideal for handling IoT applications, as it allows adequate transmission speeds for most applications and has adequate response times for those applications that are real-time critical.</p>
<p>The 6G network, whose first operational versions are scheduled for 2030, will offer data transfer speeds in the terabit second range, latency of 0.1 milliseconds, connectivity support for vehicles at speeds of up to 1,000 km/h and levels of reliability. 99.99999%.<br>
It allows multiple applications: real-time control systems for robots, massive connectivity for all types of devices (home, street furniture, laptops, bicycles), up to 107 devices per square kilometer, and the creation of mixed reality and augmented reality environments. . . , with applications as spectacular as holographic communication.<br>

<td><p><h3>In this context, the concept of common communication characteristics appears in the definition of 6G networks, which is perceived as a clear and innovative element.<br>
Example: With 6G, wireless signals can reach frequencies on the order of 3 THz (with properties closer to infrared than microwave frequencies and millimeter waves). This means that they can be used not only to send information, but also to locate objects, machines and people with great precision, even indoors. Also, determine the respiratory rate of a person.<br>
In this way, the 6G network becomes much more than a communications network and the backbone of new forms of communication both with our real and virtual environments. Of course, we will have to wait a bit for the development of technology as well as for the socio-economic and cultural context in which we live.<br>

<td><h1>What are the advantages of 6G vs. 5G?</h1><br>
<p><h3>
6G networks work using signals at the upper end of  radio frequencies.<br>
It is still too early to estimate the data transfer speed of 6G, but Dr Mahyar Shirvanimoghaddam, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, has suggested that a theoretical maximum data transfer speed of 1 terabyte per second may be possible for wireless data.<br>
<br>
This estimate applies to data sent in short bursts over limited distances.
South Korea's LG announced this type of  adaptive beamforming technology in 2021.<br>
<br>
This level of capacity and latency increases the performance of 5G applications. It  also expands capabilities to support new and innovative applications in wireless, sensing, sensing and imaging.<br>
With 6G, base stations can serve multiple clients simultaneously through orthogonal frequency division multiple access.
<br>
6G's higher frequencies will enable much faster sampling rates than with 5G. They will also provide significantly better throughput and higher data rates. The use of sub-mm waves -- wavelengths less than 1 millimeter -- and frequency selectivity to determine relative electromagnetic absorption rates is expected to advance the development of wireless sensing technology.
Mobile edge computing will be built into all 6G networks, whereas it must be added to existing 5G networks. <br>
Edge and core computing will be more integrated as part of a combined communications and computation infrastructure framework by the time 6G networks are deployed. This approach will provide many potential advantages as 6G technology becomes operational.
These benefits include improved access to AI capabilities and support for sophisticated mobile devices and systems.
